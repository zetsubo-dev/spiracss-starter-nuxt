/* ------------------------
  Shared Keyframes
------------------------ */
// This file should contain reusable animations shared across components.
// Shared animations MUST be prefixed with 'kf-' to indicate reusability.
//
// Rules:
// - @keyframes MUST be placed at root level (not inside @media/@layer)
// - Place @keyframes at the END of the file (only comments/empty lines after)
// - Component-specific animations should stay in their own SCSS files
//   and use the naming pattern: {block}-{action} (e.g., hero-section-fade-in)
